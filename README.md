# Hi. I'm Pinkles.

I'm a small boilerplate for modern web projects. Or, to put it another way, I'm a curated set of front-end development tools. I'm what you copy into your root directory for a fresh project.

## I Provide...

* A set of common CSS utility classes
* A grid framework that is flexible, zoomable, responsive, easily modifiable, and supports nesting
* A collection of media queries
# A collection of CSS3 animations for flare and functionality

## Things I'm NOT opinionated about...

* Typography (headings, block quotes, etc)
* Aesthetics (no colors, themes or skins)
* "Mobile first" design approach
* Modules (nav bars, modal windows, tabs, accordions, shelves, etc)
* Javascript

#### I require...

[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).


#### I Support...

IE8+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari.
