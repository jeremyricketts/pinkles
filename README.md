I'm a small boilerplate for modern web projects. I do a *little more* than [html5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) but I do a *lot less* than other frameworks. I steel from others, like Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and Zurb's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).
